        <strong>LIFE</strong>
    <p class="para1">
        Life is something that gives you more experience about each and everything.Everyone has a different role to play in this world.Some are ready to play but some are not ready to play.
        Life does not offer many chance for everyone.You need to use the situation and win your life.Life has to move on with non-stop even if you are in struggle.Try to find a 
        solution for problem that you face,Dont panic and stop in the place,because if you are not facing then you cannot move to next step in your life.Tha actual meaning of life is to
        fulfill your goals.I know not everyone will have goals in your life,it does not mean you are useless in this world.At some part of time you will get to know your goal in your life.
    </p>

    <strong>POSITIVITY</strong>
    <p class="para2">
        Positive thinking isn’t magic and it won’t make all of your problems disappear. What it will do is make problems seem more manageable and help you approach hardships in a more positive and productive way.
        Our life gives us many difficulties and test us with many problems.Take every problem us a lesson and learn from it instead of complaining others.Be Positive while taking decisions.
        Be sure what you are going to do,Dont confuse yourself when someone gives you idea.Be fixed in your plan and proceed.The worls is full of good and bad people.
        When you face some people,they will be with you but atlast when some problem occurs they will say you and move on.So Dont believe everyone whomever you see.Dont feel bad when someone leaves your Life
        because the people who leaves you are not a permanent one in your life,God made you realize it that this/that person is not good to you.Look,In everyones life God give a clue when you meet a bad people,
        but at that time your trust,friendship will wont accept that they are wrong,So it is not Gods mistake,It is you that you trusted the wrong person.I am not saying not to believe anyone,i am saying give your trust and hopw to the right noe
        

    </p>
    <strong>TRUST</strong>
    <p class="para3">
        Trust is confidence of a person or thing.Trust is one of the best word we give it to our loved ones.Without trust no bond can last long like friendship,family,etc.
        Trust is an inner feeling that we give to a person so that the bond become stronger.Without Trsut nothing can be built tilllast.Trust is something that is created to another personw
        without knowingly.
    </p>
    <strong>FRIENDSHIP</strong>    
    <p class="para4">
        FRIENDSHIP is a relationship of mutual affection between people.A friendship is like a four-leaf clover,hard to find and lucky to have.
        True friendship comes when silence between two people is comfortable.Good Friends are loyal and accept you for who you are during the good and bad times.
        Good Friends are also honest-honest enough to tell you when you are not being a good friend yourself.
